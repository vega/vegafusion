Installation
============


The simplest way to install altairfusion_jupyter is via pip::

    pip install altairfusion_jupyter

or via conda::

    conda install altairfusion_jupyter


If you installed via pip, and notebook version < 5.3, you will also have to
install / configure the front-end extension as well. If you are using classic
notebook (as opposed to Jupyterlab), run::

    jupyter nbextension install [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py altairfusion_jupyter

    jupyter nbextension enable [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py altairfusion_jupyter

with the `appropriate flag`_. If you are using Jupyterlab, install the extension
with::

    jupyter labextension install altairfusion-jupyter

If you are installing using conda, these commands should be unnecessary, but If
you need to run them the commands should be the same (just make sure you choose the
`--sys-prefix` flag).
