# Citing VegaFusion
A short paper entitled "[VegaFusion: Automatic Server-Side Scaling for Interactive Vega Visualizations](https://doi.org/10.1109/VIS54862.2022.00011)" was presented at the IEEEVIS 2022 conference in Oklahoma City and explains the motivations and design of VegaFusion (the paper is also [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06631) for those who don't have access to IEEE Xplore). A 7-minute video about the paper is available [on YouTube (the VegaFusion talk starts at 10:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA6BCilYXvM&t=636s).
